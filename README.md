# graphlib.c
C library to implement various graph theory algorithms

## Purpose
This project is an exercice to implement basic algorithms of graph theory to try
to understand them better.

The purpose is to have various common algorithm to test result values obtained
when doing exercices in class.

## Formats
### Matrix representation
The representation of a valuated graph by a matrix is pretty straighforward.

```
6
0 7 9 0 0 14
7 0 10 15 0 0
9 10 0 11 0 2
0 15 11 0 6 0
0 0 0 6 0 9
14 0 2 0 9 0
```

The first line is the number of vertices for the program to know how many values
to parse in total.
Then each line is the cost from the row number vertex to column number vertex.

Numerotation begins from 0 to simplify processing.

## Data structures

### graph
A graph is composed of :
* `verticesnb` - its number of vertices
* `edges` - an array of verticesnb * verticesnb integers representing the
      edge valuation. If it is 0, there is no path between the corresponding
      vertices.

For instance, given a graph `myGraph` : 
`*(myGraph.edge+(2*verticesnb)+3)` will be the cost to go from vertex 2 to
vertex 3.

### vertex
This type is meant to be linked to represent a path and is composed of :
* `vertexId` - the integer representing the unique id of the vertex
* `next` - a pointer to the next vertex in the path. If it is NULL, the current
  vertex is the last

### path
This type represent a path, with its succession of vertices, and its total cost
to go from its start to its end

## Algorithms

### Dijkstra
Finds the shortest path between a starting point and a end point

```
    path * shortest = dijkstra(myGraph, 0, 3);
    // Shortest now contains shortest path from vertex nb 0 to vertex nb 3
```

**UNTESTED** If there is no shortest path, returns { INFINITY, NULL }.

## TODOs
* Implement secure parsing from file
* Implement errors management :
    * Matrix not correctly formated
    * Matrix not representing a complete graph
* Implement other lighter formats such as successors lists
* Prim's algorithm
* Bellman-Ford's algorithm
* Minimum/maximum spanning tree
* Makefile
* args parsing rather than changing stdin
* Migrating some helper functions to c_utils.c
